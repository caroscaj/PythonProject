Purpose
The purpose of this script was to create the data cleanup tool for csv files. This script allows for me to clean csv files easily, examples like duplicated rows shown. It will write the data to a new copy allowing you to see the differences between each and have previous version of that file. 

Self-Evaluation
How many points do you deserve on this assignment: 85, I believe I have completed a working functional code for cleaning up data in csv. This script allows a user to do many different tasks. I believe the rubric was fully covered to the best of my ability. 

Self-Reflection
How long it took you to finish this?
